## About

This is a work in progress Shiny application that allows the user to filter, subset and visualize the patch notes for the video game "Destiny" with a heavy focus on weapon and subclass balance changes.

A running version of this application can be seen [here!](https://jbccollins.shinyapps.io/destinypatchnotesexplorer/) (Keep in mind that it's VERY much a work in progress)
